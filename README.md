# React with MobX


### **2 x Data Stores**
1. UI State
> Using container/class state may be sufficient for some UI but after a while you may need another container/class to use the same state. Instead of pushing that state up like in a standard react way, you will end up putting this state into the **ui-state-store**

2. Domain State
 
> The main responsibility of stores is to move logic and state out of your components into a standalone testable unit that can be used in both frontend and backend JavaScript.
